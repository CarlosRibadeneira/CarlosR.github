									<h2><a href="#">About me:<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Carlos Ribadeneira and I am a data analyst. I have been trained to understand business complexities, identify problems, devise solutions and seek opportunities. Since I started my education as a Business Engineer, I began to look at the world from a different perspective. 
										I joined a research training group and shortly after I took my first steps as a researcher. As I was walking in this rewarding journey, I was part of various projects where I was fortunate enough to explore different business problems, understand and clean their data, as well as work closely with a team to develop models. 
										As part of my research group, we addressed projects such as developing methodology to identify IT processes, propose sustainable business models with circular economy principles, enhance financial sustainability for electric and electronic waste in a city and evaluate KPI of local governments.
										Working in academia was the perfect way to integrate research with the public sector. These experiences impelled me to continue my education and focus on my passion “business decisions driven by data,” but this time in the private sector. I  graduated with a Master’s of Science in Business Analytics. Meanwhile, I have been working as a market analyst. 
										I have been able to apply my new set of skills and strengthen my old ones. Working towards becoming a better data analyst has taught me that value generation and continuous improvement are  directly proportional to constant learning, discipline, honesty, hard work and of course, meaningful data leading to actionable steps. 
										I am excited to present a few projects that helped me consolidate my technical knowledge.</p>

									<p>Understanding SQL and the theory behind databases was the beginning of my new passion. It was complex and even torturous at times, but fascinating nonetheless. I was exposed to many different projects that help me understand the fundaments of relational databases while learning the syntax of SQL. </p>

									<p>I have had the opportunity to work on python, specifically in Jupiter notebooks, for quite some time. I compiled some projects that were the cornerstone for my python journey. I am certainly just beginning to navigate this vast language. However, I am confident I have a clear understanding of the basics and its applicability in real life business problems.</p>

									<p>In this section of my portfolio I am presenting a small compilation of projects that I carried out in R. I had the opportunity to consolidate key statistical concepts using this powerful language. I tested and increased my knowledge progressively by focusing on the syntax. Next, I practiced writing functions. Moreover, I created and interpreted supervised models.</p>

									<p>Visualizing the information is crucial for an organization. This project shows my growth utilizing Power BI to convey important messages. I used a Turnover Database from Louisville metro open data. I showed a list of improvement and a screen shot of the changes. This project helped me enhance my data communication skills. Furthermore, I analyzed a Restaurant Inspection dataset taken from the open data Louisville, KY website. My dashboard focuses on scores and inspections of restaurants graded “A” in 2021 excluding October. I showcased a couple of important features of the dashboard.</p>
