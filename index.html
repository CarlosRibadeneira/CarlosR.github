									<h2><a href="#">About me:<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Carlos Ribadeneira and I am a data analyst. When I started my education as a Business Engineer and I started to look at world from a different lenses. I was trained to understand business complexities, identify problem, devise solutions and seek opportunities. 
										I was quickly enchanted by the continuous improvement concept ubiquitously present in all the business cases I analyzed. As I acquire more knowledge in my studies, I realized that understanding the key pieces of data dispersed in every area of a business produces information that could lead to continuous improvement. 
										Yes, continuous improvement driven by data rather than hunches. Combining data and a continuous improvement philosophy inspire me to start my professional journey. I joined a research training group and shortly after I made my first steps as a researcher.
										As I was walking in this rewarding journey, I was part of various projects where I was fortunate enough to explore different business problems, understand and clean their data as well as work closely with the teams developing models. 
										As part of my research group, we addressed projects such as developing methodology to identify IT processes, propose sustainable business models with circular economy principles, enhance financial sustainability for electric and electronic waste in a city and evaluate KPI of local governments.  
										Working in Academia was the perfect way to integrate research and the public sector. These experiences, impel me to continue my education and focus on my passion “business decision driven by data” but this time in the private sector. 
										I will be graduating in December with a Master of Science in Business Analytics. Meanwhile, I have been working as a market analyst using tools such python, R, SQL and power BI to manage the sales database and identify opportunities. 
										Working towards becoming a better data analyst has taught me that continuous improvement is directly proportional to constant learning, discipline, honesty, hard work and of course meaningful data leading actionable steps. I am excited to present a few projects that helped me consolidate my technical knowledge.</p>

									<p>Understanding SQL and the theory behind data bases was the beginning of my new passion. It was complex, torturous at times but fascinating nonetheless.  
										I was exposed to many different projects that help me understand the fundaments of relational data bases while meanwhile learning the syntax of SQL.
										Words such as entities, attributes, relationships keys, normalization, select, from, where, group by, having, joins and many more gained a completely different meaning to me and opened my mind to the data world. 
										I am adding a compilation of projects that show my growth in this amazing field.</p>

									<p>I have been having the opportunity to work on python specifically in Jupiter notebooks for quite some time. 
										I compiled some projects that were the cornerstone for my python journey. I am certainly just beginning navigating this vast language.
										However, I am confident I have a clear understanding of its basics and its applicability in real life business problems. </p>

									<p>In this section of my portfolio I am presenting a small compilation of projects that I carried out in R. 
										I had the opportunity to consolidate key statistical concepts using this powerful language. 
										I tested and increased my knowledge progressively by focusing on the syntax.
										Next, I practiced writing functions. Moreover, I created and interpreted supervised models. </p>

									<p>Visualizing the information is crucial for an organization. This projects shows my growth utilizing Power BI to convey important messages. 
										I used a Turnover Database from Louisville metro open data. I showed a list of  improvement and screen shot of the changes. 
										This project helped me enhanced my data communication skills. Furthermore, I analyzed a Restaurant Inspection dataset taken from the open data Louisville, KY website. 
										My dashboard focuses on scores and inspections of restaurants graded “A” in 2021 excluding October. 
										I showcased a couple important features of the dashboard.  </p>
